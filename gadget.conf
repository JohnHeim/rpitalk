# RPITalk USB Gadget Configuration
#
# This file controls how the Raspberry Pi identifies itself
# to the host computer over USB when acting as a speech
# synthesizer emulator.
#
# By changing the PRODUCT_ID and PRODUCT string, the Pi can
# pretend to be different hardware synthesizers (e.g. DECtalk
# or LiteTalk).  The host's udev rules can then load the
# correct Speakup driver based on these values.
#

# Enable or disable USB gadget mode entirely.
# Set to 0 (zero) to disable.
ENABLE_GADGET=1

# USB Vendor ID.
# All RPITalk devices should normally use the same vendor ID.
VENDOR_ID=0x1d6b

#
# USB Product ID.
# Choose ONE of the following depending on which synth
# you want to emulate:
#
#   DECtalk emulator: 0x0104
#   LiteTalk emulator: 0x0105
#
PRODUCT_ID=0x0104

# USB serial number string.
# This can be any identifier; including the emulation type
# can be useful for debugging.
SERIAL="rpitalk-dectalk-001"

# USB manufacturer string (human-readable).
MANUFACTURER="RPITalk Development Team"

#
# USB product string (shown by lsusb and in kernel logs).
# This should describe which synth is being emulated.
#
# Examples:
#   "RPITalk DECtalk Emulator"
#   "RPITalk LiteTalk Emulator"
#
PRODUCT="RPITalk DECtalk Emulator"

# Configuration name string (normally not critical).
CONFIGURATION_NAME="RPITalk Synth Config"
