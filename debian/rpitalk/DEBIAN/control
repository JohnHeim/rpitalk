Description: DECtalk-compatible speech synthesizer emulator for Raspberry Pi
 rpitalk provides software for turning a Raspberry Pi into a
 DECtalk-compatible hardware speech synthesizer.
 .
 When run on a Raspberry Pi with an OTG (gadget) USB port,
 this package emulates the DECtalk command protocol and uses Speech
 Dispatcher as a backend, allowing a screen  reader on a
 host computer to produce speech through a modern text-to-speech
 engine.
