Description: DECtalk-compatible speech synthesizer emulator for Raspberry Pi
 rpitalk provides software for turning a Raspberry Pi into a
 DECtalk-compatible hardware speech synthesizer.
 .
 It emulates the DECtalk command protocol and uses Speech Dispatcher
 as a backend, allowing legacy software designed for DECtalk hardware
 to produce speech through modern text-to-speech engines.
 .
 This package is intended for use with serial or USB connections so
 a Raspberry Pi can function as a standalone speech synthesizer device.
