Description: Hardware speech synthesizer emulator for Raspberry Pi
 rpitalk provides software for turning a Raspberry Pi into a
 legacy hardware speech synthesizer emulator.
 .
 It supports emulation of DECtalk-compatible and LiteTalk-compatible
 devices and implements their serial command protocols.
 .
 rpitalk is intended for use on a Raspberry Pi with a USB OTG (gadget) port,
 where it listens on a virtual serial device and uses Speech Dispatcher as a
 backend, allowing screen readers or other software on a host computer to
 produce speech through a modern text-to-speech engine. It can also be used
 on other machines with a standard serial port if desired.
 .
 The emulator may be configured using /etc/rpitalk/emulator.conf and
 supports multiple emulation modes selectable at runtime.
